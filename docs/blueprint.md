# **App Name**: NudgeWealth

## Core Features:

- Transaction Monitoring: Real-time monitoring of user transaction patterns across various categories.
- Configurable Rules Engine: Allow users to set spending limits and time-window locks for impulse control based on transaction categories. Enforce these rules in real-time.
- Overspend Detection: Detect when a user exceeds their predefined spending limits based on their configurable rules.
- Automated Micro-Investment Redirect: Automatically redirect excess expenditures towards micro-investments or savings pots when spending limits are reached. The tool will evaluate whether the money can instead be invested in higher returns accounts, and will reroute money.
- Soft/Hard Alerts: Notify users with soft or hard alerts when they approach or exceed spending limits. This notification may also take the form of suggested micro-investment opportunities.
- Admin Dashboard: Provide an admin dashboard displaying anonymized behavior clustering and nudge effectiveness metrics. For instance, this dashboad reports what rules were effective with the 'student' cluster
