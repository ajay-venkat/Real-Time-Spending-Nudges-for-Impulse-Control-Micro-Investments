# NudgeWealth 🚀

**Real-Time Spending Nudges for Impulse Control & Micro-Investments**

## 📝 Abstract

Impulsive digital spending through food delivery, online shopping, and subscription services significantly reduces savings and exacerbates financial inequality among young adults and students in India. **NudgeWealth** is a real-time spending behavior analysis and nudge engine that monitors transaction patterns, enforces user-configurable rules (category-based limits, time-window locks for impulse control), and automatically redirects excess expenditures toward micro-investments or savings pots. 

The system employs data analytics for pattern detection and overspend triggering, with soft/hard alerts and an admin dashboard providing anonymized behavior clustering and nudge effectiveness metrics. By promoting disciplined financial habits and redirecting impulsive spends to wealth-building actions, it directly contributes to **UN Sustainable Development Goals 1 (No Poverty), 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and 10 (Reduced Inequalities)**, fostering long-term economic empowerment and inclusion for underserved users.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Dynamic Dashboard**: A real-time overview of your financial pulse, including balances, spending trends, and active goals.
- **Impulse Control Rules Engine**: Set "hard stops" or "time locks" on specific spending categories (e.g., blocking food delivery apps after 10 PM) to curb impulsive behavior.
- **AI-Powered Nudges**: Personalized advice and intervention messages generated by Google's Gemini models via Genkit, helping you rethink purchases before they happen.
- **Intelligent Micro-Investments**: Automatically identifies surplus funds and recommends tailored micro-investment opportunities or savings "pots" based on current market conditions.
- **Behavioral Analytics (Admin)**: Anonymized clustering and nudge effectiveness tracking for deep insights into system-wide financial health.
- **Transaction History**: A detailed log of all financial activities and NudgeWealth interventions.
